Fork of a Chat-GPD(?) script to automate the download process of vortex collections as a non-premium user. Added some QoL and improvements to the script. I know nothing about phyton, but it works pretty well? Downloaded 1200 mods without any major problems. (There are still "custom" popups which require manual interaction, but they are really rare.)

Usage:
- Download everything (yes, the pictures too), move everything into the same folder and start the .py script.
- Open vortex and start installation a mod collection.
- Move the vortex window to your main screen.
- Wait until a browser window opens and move it to the main screen too.
- Go AFK and wait until everything is done.

(Looks like the script can't find windows on other monitors, make sure the browser always opens/stays on your main screen.)

Dependencies:
pip install pyautogui
pip install opencv-python
